# Sound of Fractions #

**Sound of Fractions** is a teaching aid designed to help learn the concept of fractions using a multimodal representation. The main concept is that measures can be dividing into sub-sections and manipulated to produce music. As these changes occur, the mathematical representation of the measures are constructed and updated.  That way, students can see how fractions relate both visually and aurally. This is similar to block manipulative used currently to teach fractions with the addition of sound.

## Installing ##

This project is a web app that uses Javascript, Web Audio API, Node, D3, Backbone, Jquery, Underscore, and lots of rythym! Web Audio is only accessible via a compatible browser (currently (2/15) only Chrome).

For a single page demo click [here](http://compthink.cs.vt.edu).

Previous version were built Using Ruby on Rails.   Check the Master branch for working versions.

### Naming ###
We follow naming conventions for both the recording industry (htracks, transporter, etc...) and traditional musical performances (conductor, measure, beats, etc...).

### Music Playback ###

To play music, click the play button (triangle in the circle). When playing, the play button will change into the stop button and an animation will begin showing what beats are currently playing.  To stop, just press the stop button present, and both the sound and animations will stop.

### Adding New Instruments ###

To add an instrument, use the genereator at the bottom of the screen

### Transition Measure Representations ###

To transition a representation, click the delta sign in the upper left of a representation, the the button of the type you want in the upper right of the screen.

## Future Plans ##

This project is currently a work in progress.  We have additional features we would like to implement as well as lesson plans we want to develop.  We are currently keeping track of code related bugs and feature requests through github.  If you are interested in developing a lesson plan, or have a lesson plan that could utilize this application please let us know!
