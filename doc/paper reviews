Brain Points
---
When gamifying fraction learning, their system of giving points performs better with low performing students.
Some of the more progressive features of their point system are
  the ability to reset or start over, looking at when distinct components are used, or a new idea is used.
Some of the traditional measurements are 
  when a target mathematical feature are reached and when 10 distinct new sets of moves are made

Virtual vs physical manipulatives
Virtual 
  auto-calculating
    This doesn't address the design choice we've made to not make it auto-calculating to avoid the student doing self evaluation
physical
  students tend to play games with manipulatives
    i think this is part of the strength as we have the physical activities.  Even if we introduce manipulatives, it is in a playful arena
  hard to distribute/setup/collect
    This could be included in the instruction and executed by the students themselves
