Brain Points
---
When gamifying fraction learning, their system of giving points performs better with low performing students.
Some of the more progressive features of their point system are
  the ability to reset or start over, looking at when distinct components are used, or a new idea is used.
Some of the traditional measurements are 
  when a target mathematical feature are reached and when 10 distinct new sets of moves are made

Virtual vs physical manipulatives
Virtual 
  auto-calculating
    This doesn't address the design choice we've made to not make it auto-calculating to avoid the student doing self evaluation
physical
  students tend to play games with manipulatives
    i think this is part of the strength as we have the physical activities.  Even if we introduce manipulatives, it is in a playful arena
  hard to distribute/setup/collect
    This could be included in the instruction and executed by the students themselves

DeFT: A conceptual framework for considering learning with multiple representations: Shaaron Ainsworth
---------
Design
  There are two worlds provided by a representation, the actual world, and the depicted world. Very similar to the communication model of perceptions of interpersonal interaction (self vs other and the six associations - A's perception of A, A's perception of B, A's perception of B's perception of A, B's perception of B, B's perception of A, B's perception of A's perception of B)
  Important factors
    how the information is distributed
    form of the reps
    number of reps
      sequence/order of reps
    support for translation
Functions
  computational offloading - allows for reference of information or staging of knowledge
  Complement[ary roles]
    The reps are different by supporting processes or containing information
      They talk about individual student preference with rep choices
      The rep should match the task

    they just talk about how they are a cohesive whole, not so much of individual parts
  Constrain[ Interpretation]
    Graphical reps are more specific than textual reps
  Construct[ Deeper understanding]
    Relational, abstraction, extension
Tasks
  students need to learn how to properly select, construct, and apply the rep to a domain
student's expertise with a domain may allow for a deeper understanding of what a representation means/shows
