icat activity day

mostly boys
- all but two were Caucasian

noticeably hard UI problems
 - the mute buttons
 - finding an instrument
 what to do after clicking on a measure rep 
  - maybe this has math implications of what are you adding [to]


One student commented that 'this is similar to fractions' 

Students seemed to be polarized in performance with the tasks.

Unanimously drawn to the colors

Some students try to arrange the beats on the measure 
one student began trying to match the tapping after the audio started to play

some were distracted by the OS level stuff, so next time it should be in full screen.

There were two students who counted by the opaque, and could not differentiate 4/5 from 4/9 
  the would count the transparent beats upon instruction, but it was difficult for them to differentiate still.

Some students could not perceive the differentiation in the audio levels of the two instruments

two students focused on the audio rep for the checking of its sync
