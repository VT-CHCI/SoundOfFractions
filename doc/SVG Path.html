              Command   Parameters                                          Repeatable    Explanation
Pen Command    
              M ( m )   x, y                                                Yes   moveto:
                                                                                    Move the pen to a new location. No line is drawn. All path    data must begin with a 'moveto' command.
Line Commands    
              L ( l )   x, y                                                Yes   lineto:

                                                                                    Draw a horizontal line from the current point to x.
              V ( v )   y                                                   Yes   vertical lineto:
                                                                                    Draw a horizontal line from the current point to y.
Cubic Bezier Curve Commands
              C ( c )   x1 y1 x2 y2 x y                                     Yes   curveto:
                                                                                    Draw a cubic Bézier curve from the current point to the point (x,y) using (x1,y1) as the control point at the beginning of the curve and (x2,y2) as the control point at the end of the curve.
              S ( s )   x2 y2 x y                                           Yes   shorthand/smooth curveto:
                                                                                    Draw a cubic Bézier curve from the current point to (x,y). The first control point is assumed to be the reflection of the last control point on the previous command relative to the current point. (x2,y2) is the second control point (i.e., the control point at the end of the curve).
Quadratic Bezier Curve Commands
              Q ( q )   x1 y1 x y                                           Yes   quadratic Bézier curveto:
                                                                                    Draw a quadratic Bézier curve from the current point to (x,y) using (x1,y1) as the control point.
              T ( t )   x y                                                 Yes   Shorthand/smooth quadratic Bézier curveto:
                                                                                    Draw a quadratic Bézier curve from the current point to (x,y). The control point is assumed to be the reflection of the control point on the previous command relative to the current point.
Elliptical Arc Curve Command
              A ( a )   rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y Yes   elliptical arc:
                                                                                    Draws an elliptical arc from the current point to (x, y). The size and orientation of the ellipse are defined by two radii (rx, ry) and an x-axis-rotation, which indicate how the ellipse as a whole is rotated relative to the current SVG coordinate system. The center (cx, cy) of the ellipse is calculated automatically to satisfy the constraints imposed by the other parameters. large-arc-flag and sweep-flag contribute to the automatic calculations and help determine how the arc is drawn.
End Path Command
              Z ( z )   none                                                No    closepath:
                                                                                    Closes the path. A line is drawn from the last point to the first point drawn.
