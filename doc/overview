What constitutes a whole?

Additive factory // This is a factory that has beats that are readily available to be placed into a song
 + beats //There should be beats of different sizes/lengths

## Entities

*   component / sheet/tab/track?
    *   instrument
    *   name // a name of the instrument
    *   icon //an image that symbolizes the instrument
    *   sound/sample // a unique sound, that sounds the length of a beat, and has other attenuation properties based on the ordered number of the beat
    *   music sections
    *   measure (Â¿defined by beats with certain properties?) //Comprised of a one or more beats
    *   fraction represntation section //this is where the fraction representation area is placed
*   assignment //created by a teacher, is a series of steps/questions/activities that should help teach, test, and assess a student to a new idea or thought
    *   goal //the activities purpose or end state as described by the teacher
    *   questions //The appropriate questions being asked to the students at the appropriate times during their interaction
    *   assessment //an auto checking function() that checks if the student completed the task, and to what degree, and reports the results to the appropriate places {db tables/views/logs}
*   beat //a visual and audio represented portion of a measure/song, that can be played, rested,
*   song //A sample of beats played at a specific temp0 created by the student
*   measure representation //A step higher than a beat, but still a graphical way of representing the properties of a measure of a song
*   beat representation //A graphical way of representing the audio song’s beats {audio/h-bar/v-bar/pie/bead/numberLine}
*   fraction representation //One of the standard ways of representing a fraction {fraction/percentage/decimal/mixedNumber}
*   beats per measure //This can be set manually, or calculated automatically, or even questioned to the student user
*   tempo //Tempo, a rate, should be defined in distance/time so that it is consistent across representations
*   play //toggle the animations and the sounds ON
*   auto-rotate/play // whether or not to loop
*   pause // Pause the Music and the animation, allowing for resuming at the same point upon clicking pause again
*   factory // a place where you can always retrieve something
*   stop //Stop the music and the animation, and reset the play position to the beginning
*   box? {mold/cast/window/template/view/perspective/perception/viewport/movement/module/section} //an element that contains other entities that can be moved as one collection
*   navbar // a simple navigation bar, specific to the type of user
    *   menu // a menu that is based on the type of user
    *   student // this should have assignments
    *   teacher // this should have students, progress, CRUD assignments
    *   login // an area to login and logout and access profile info
    *   list of songs // a list of songs that the user has saved
    *   list of participants in class //a list of other users in proximity set by class
*   question area // a place where questions can be asked to the students
    *   question // questions from the teacher’s preset scenario, and in revolving access so the student can build on and come back to
    *   answer area // a place where the student will type their answer
*   live interactive feedback // an alert or area that shows live information, such as a when a beat is tapped by the student, which count the song is on, or other immediate feedback needed of attributes
*   construction sandbox // where the teacher makes the different assignments/tasks by allowing certain entities or representations visible, and certain functions possible
*   performance review or grades // an overview of each student that the teacher teaches and their metrics within the program

## Fraction Representations

*   type // {none/proper,improper fraction/mixed number/decimal/percentage/query challenge }
    *   none //blank area
    *   proper/improper // y/z
    *   mixed number // X y/z
    *   decimal // _._*
    *   degree of precision?
+percentage // **%
    *   degree of precision?
    *   query challenge //the student is asked to enter the amount in a particular form
*   auto calculation? // the auto calculation should count beats? rests? both?

## Measure/Beat Representations

*   audio // a single circle that pulses at each beat
*   vertical bar
*   bar
*   number line
*   pie
*   bead
*   group

        *   3 x 3 matrix for 9 beats per measure
    *   9 randomly presented beats (non-overlaying)
*   transition // an animation that is triggered to show what is conserved in each representation

        *   from

        *   to

        *   audio

        *   number line

            *   move the single beat along a linear path, and as each beat pulses, have it remain in the place it started pulsing
        *   the line is drawn as the single beat moves along its path
        *   then add the markers
    *   bead

            *   move the single beat along a circular path, and as each beat pulses, have it remain in the place it started pulsing
        *   the circular line is drawn as the single beat moves along its path
    *   bar

        *   number line

            *   transition the beats to whatever number line representation is
        *   add the markers
    *   number line

        *   bar

            *   remove the markers
        *   transition the beats into the bar representation
    *   pie
 +
+ radial
+ bead
 + number line
 + unroll to straight line, then add markers
 + The circumference is equal to the length of the line
 + bar
 + unroll to straight line, then stretch the beat beads into the squares
 + pie
 + stretch the beads to the pie slices
 + audio
 + unroll to straight line, the overlap the beats into one circle

## Attributes

*   count // current beat in song
*   labels

        *   counting numbers // count beats within the measure
    *   fractions // auto calc area

## Math

*   add

        *   beat
    *   beat after the {third position}
    *   beat {20%, 40%, 50% after the {first, second, third beat}
*   subtract

        *   beat
    *   first {half, quarter, fifth}
*   divide

        *   half time
*   multiply
+double time

## Music

*   compare

        *   song {a, b} from yourself
    *   song a from yourself to song a of a classmate
*   compose

        *   song yourself
    *   song with a classmate

## General features

*   metrics

        *   most beats in a song
    *   longest song (time)
    *   most worked on (diff between created and updated? or sessions?)
*   awards completed assignments
*   teaching give awards for completing simple tasks used to introduce the program

## Outside of the program

*   users {student/teacher/admin} //the people using the program
*   tapping fingers/drumsticks/clapping/slapping //an embodied interaction by the student to compose their own music song, with tapping the desk or a key
*   counting internal / outloud / paper
*   student

        *   intended user
    *   completes assignments made by the teacher
    *   has a playground with full functionality
*   class all students in one class(~15–35 students in one meeting)
*   school all students/classes in a school
*   district all schools in an area
*   teacher can make assignments and program states
*   partner another student, that completes the task(s) with the student
*   group students that complete the task(s) together
