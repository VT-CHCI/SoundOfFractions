What constitutes a whole?

Additive factory // This is a factory that has beats that are readily available to be placed into a song
  + beats  //There should be beats of different sizes/lengths

## Entities ##
  + component / sheet/tab/track?
    + instrument
      + name // a name of the instrument
      + icon //an image that symbolizes the instrument
      + sound/sample // a unique sound, that sounds the length of a beat, and has other attenuation properties based on the ordered number of the beat
    + music sections
      + measure (¿defined by beats with certain properties?) //Comprised of a one or more beats
    + fraction represntation section //this is where the fraction representation area is placed
  + assignment //created by a teacher, is a series of steps/questions/activities that should help teach, test, and assess a student to a new idea or thought
    + goal //the activities purpose or end state as described by the teacher
    + questions //The appropriate questions being asked to the students at the appropriate times during their interaction
    + assessment //an auto checking function() that checks if the student completed the task, and to what degree, and reports the results to the appropriate places {db tables/views/logs} 
  + beat //a visual and audio represented portion of a measure/song, that can be played, rested, 
  + song //A sample of beats played at a specific temp0 created by the student
  + measure representation //A step higher than a beat, but still a graphical way of representing the properties of a measure of a song
  + beat representation //A graphical way of representing the audio song's beats {audio/h-bar/v-bar/pie/bead/numberLine}
  + fraction representation //One of the standard ways of representing a fraction {fraction/percentage/decimal/mixedNumber}
  + beats per measure //This can be set manually, or calculated automatically, or even questioned to the student user
  + tempo //Tempo, a rate, should be defined in distance/time so that it is consistent across representations
  + play //toggle the animations and the sounds ON
  + auto-rotate/play // whether or not to loop
  + pause // Pause the Music and the animation, allowing for resuming at the same point upon clicking pause again
  + factory // a place where you can always retrieve something
  + stop //Stop the music and the animation, and reset the play position to the beginning
  + box? {mold/cast/window/template/view/perspective/perception/viewport/movement/module/section} //an element that contains other entities that can be moved as one collection
  + navbar // a simple navigation bar, specific to the type of user
    + menu // a menu that is based on the type of user
      + student // this should have assignments
      + teacher // this should have students, progress, CRUD assignments
    + login // an area to login and logout and access profile info
    + list of songs // a list of songs that the user has saved
    + list of participants in class //a list of other users in proximity set by class
  + question area // a place where questions can be asked to the students
    + question // questions from the teacher's preset scenario, and in revolving access so the student can build on and come back to
    + answer area // a place where the student will type their answer
  + live interactive feedback // an alert or area that shows live information, such as a when a beat is tapped by the student, which count the song is on, or other immediate feedback needed of attributes
  + construction sandbox // where the teacher makes the different assignments/tasks by allowing certain entities or representations visible, and certain functions possible
  + performance review or grades // an overview of each student that the teacher teaches and their metrics within the program

## Fraction Representations ##
  + type // {none/proper,improper fraction/mixed number/decimal/percentage/query challenge }
    + none //blank area
    + proper/improper // y/z
    + mixed number // X y/z
    + decimal // *.**
      + degree of precision?
    +percentage // **%
      + degree of precision?
    + query challenge //the student is asked to enter the amount in a particular form
  + auto calculation? // the auto calculation should count beats? rests? both? 

## Measure/Beat Representations ##
  + audio // a single circle that pulses at each beat
  + vertical bar
  + bar
  + number line
  + pie
  + bead
  + group
    + 3 x 3 matrix for 9 beats per measure
    + 9 randomly presented beats (non-overlaying)
  + transition // an animation that is triggered to show what is conserved in each representation
    + from
      + to
    + audio
      + number line
        + move the single beat along a linear path, and as each beat pulses, have it remain in the place it started pulsing
        + the line is drawn as the single beat moves along its path
        + then add the markers
      + bead
        + move the single beat along a circular path, and as each beat pulses, have it remain in the place it started pulsing
        + the circular line is drawn as the single beat moves along its path
    + bar
      + number line
        + transition the beats to whatever number line representation is
        + add the markers
    + number line
      + bar
        + remove the markers
        + transition the beats into the bar representation
    + pie
      + 
    + radial
    + bead
      + number line
        + unroll to straight line, then add markers
        + The circumference is equal to the length of the line
      + bar
        + unroll to straight line, then stretch the beat beads into the squares
      + pie
        + stretch the beads to the pie slices
      + audio
        + unroll to straight line, the overlap the beats into one circle

## Attributes ##
  + count // current beat in song
  + labels 
    + counting numbers // count beats within the measure
    + fractions // auto calc area
