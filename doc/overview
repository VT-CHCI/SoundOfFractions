What constitutes a whole?

additive palette
// This is a factory that has beats that are readily available to be placed into a song
  beats
  //There should be beats of different sizes/lengths

entities
  component / sheet/tab/track?
    instrument
      name
      // a name of the instrument
      icon
      //an image that symbolizes the instrument
      sound/sample
      // a unique sound, that sounds the length of a beat, and has other attentuation properties based on the ordered number of the beat
    music section
      measure (¿defined by beats with certain properties?)
      //Comprised of a one or more beats
    fraction represntation section
    //this is where the fraction representation area is placed

  assignment
  //created by a teacher, is a series of steps/questions/activities that should help teach, test, and assess a student to a new idea or thought
    goal
    //the activities purpose or end state as described by the teacher
    questions
    //The appropriate questions being asked to the students at the appropriate times during their interaction
    assessment
    //an auto checking function() that checks if the student completed the task, and to what degree, and reports the results to the appropriate places {db tables/views/logs}
  beat
  //a visual and audio represented portion of a measure/song, that can be played, rested, 
  song
  //A sample of beats played at a specific temp0 created by the student
  measure representation
  //A step higher than a beat, but still a graphical way of representing the properties of a measure of a song
  beat representation
  //A graphical way of representing the audio song's beats {audio/h-bar/v-bar/pie/bead/numberLine}
  fraction representation
  //One of the standard ways of representing a fraction {fraction/percentage/decimal/mixedNumber}
  beats per measure
  //This can be set manually, or calculated automatically, or even questioned to the student user
  tempo
  //Tempo, a rate, should be defined in distance/time so that it is consistent across representations
  play
  //toggle the animations and the sounds ON
  pause
  // Pause the Music and the animation, allowing for resuming at the same point upon clicking pause again
  factory 
  // a place where you can always retrieve something
  stop
  //Stop the music and the animation, and reset the play position to the beginning
  box? {mold/cast/window/template/view/perspective/perception/viewport/movement/module/section}

      // this should have students, progress, CRUD assignments
    login
    // an area to login and logout and access profile info
    list of songs
    //a list of songs that the user has saved
    list of participants in class
    //a list of other users in proximity set by class
  question area
  // a place where questions can be asked to the students
    question
    // questions from the teacher's preset scenario, and in revolving access so the student can build on and come back to
    answer area
    // a place where the student will type their answer
  construction sandbox
  // where the teacher makes thge different 
  performance review / grades
  // an overview of each student that the teacher teaches and their metrics within the program

fraction representations
  type
  // {none/proper,improper fraction/mixed number/decimal/percentage/query challenge }
    none

    proper/improper
    // y/z
    mixed number
    // X y/z
    decimal
    // *.**
    // degree of precision?

    audio
      number line
      // move the single beat along a linear path, and as each beat pulses, have it remain in the place it started pulsing
