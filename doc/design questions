  Settings and Configuration
    Should this be a session in and of itself, as testing with 20+ kids will change the experience.

Composition
  Is the only way to construct a song by tapping, or can it also be constructed graphically?
  Are a "record" and "stop" button needed?
  How do we enable constant audio usage of the microphone?
  How do we handle the user accidentally clicking no to "allow the webpage to use your microphone?"
  If we capture beat intensity during replaying, should we replay it with the same intensity?
  Beat intensity aids in analysis of the repetition to identify the down beat and the end of the pattern.  This assumes a measure starts with a beat, and not a rest.   The analysis can also exist without beat intensity, just requires a different approach. Do we need intensity?
  How does beat intensity effect the animation?
  What is the minimum beat length?
  How does composition differ from editing?

Representations
  Audio:
    This representation has a minimalist graphic representation for spatialy conceptualizing the music
    How do we ask a student to identify a specific beat, given that beats are presented chronologically, with no spatial representation?
