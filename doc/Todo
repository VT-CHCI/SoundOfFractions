Working on curriculum to show:
- the progression from music to embodied interactions to math
- include ways to incorporate indicators of student learning with SoF activities (such as the ordering, conservation, size, equivalence)

Look at the activities for the children's museum :
- playing around and asking what did you learn
- make a rhythm and an accompanying representation
- make a rhythm and ask if they recognize it

music to embodied to math
break in a written math challenge/exercise in between each of music tasks
  looking for indicators

I I O is it equal to
O I I ?


Reread empson
make a trial task to make one rep and have the students match a separate different representation
scwartz and bransford

Done
- Write the Makey Makey Grant


Continue on thinking through the trial study
Set up a meeting with Phyllis about running more studies
read papers in journal of cognition and instruction
read papers surrounding general symbolizing math instruction
Submit the IRB for the study
Bring some papers I have read with summary judgments that speak to what the paper is about and provides or lacks

Long term:
follow up with steve about HCD certificate
follow up with meeghan about force add
