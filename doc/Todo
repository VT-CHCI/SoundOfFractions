My todo for the next bit:
- Write the Makey Makey Grant
- reading more work/literature

Working on curriculum to show:
- the progression from music to embodied interactions to math
- include ways to incorporate indicators of student learning with SoF activities (such as the ordering, conservation, size, equivalence)

Look at the activities for the children's museum :
- playing around and asking what did you learn
- make a rhythm and an accompanying representation
- make a rhythm and ask if they recognize it

music to embodied to math
break in a written math challenge/excercise in between each of music tasks
  looking for indicators

I I O is it equal to
O I I ?

play around, what did you learn
make song and accompanying represetnation
make a song , do you recognize it

reading widely focused work

Reread empson
make a trial task to make one rep and have the students match a separate different representation
scwartz and bransford
  


Done:
follow up with HCD certificate and force add srh
- Test the system (esp with multiple devices)
