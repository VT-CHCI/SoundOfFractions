Project Description *
Describe the significance, specific aims, methods, assessment
  Students can struggle in particular academic areas, while excelling in others. Fractions in early mathematics often pose the largest and longest lasting hindrance for future progression in mathematics and abstract thinking. Music is appreciated by students and provides students opportunities to skillfully produce music themselves. Importantly, musical theory has many features that are relatable to features in mathematical language. We utilize interest in music as a motivating feature for a new socio-technical approach to teaching fractions. The Sound of Fractions (SoF) incorporates three key ideas: (1) working with both the whole and the part at the same time is crucial in learning fractions, (2) drumming is a compelling, embodied, culturally-relevant activity that allows students to experience the parts, whole, and the relationships between them, and (3) by creating a new representational infrastructure, we can create viable, classroom based activities that bridge between percussion-related activities and mathematics-related activities.

  We will use embodied interaction to allow students to create their own musical rhythms that can be represented graphically in the Sound of Fractions.  We currently allow the students to tap into the microphone on a laptop, and we do beat analysis on the audio signal.  This works great fro small groups, however, when there are many students in a physical space that is not properly audio dampening, noise is a problem for each recording.   We have tested a Makey Makey alternative input device to capture the tapping when recording music.  It provides a perfect plug and play device still allowing the students to perform their musical rhythm while maintaining the signal clarity needed for audio processing.

Statement of Innovation *
Describe what is new, novel, unique about this proposal
  While music and math are easily thought to be related, there is not significant research into using making music and its inherent attributes as the forefront of math introduction and education.  We have developed the Sound of Fractions to be used as a tool in teaching fractions to student through music.  Our approach is novel in two spefically strong ways.  First, we use music as the starting point.  From there, we pose questions that challenge the students to understand abstract concepts that are required for mastering fractions.   We do this by posing questions that highlight the parts and the whole at the same time.  Second, we have a novel graphical representation, called the 'bead', that we use to describe the rhythms that the students perform.   It has the capability of being transformed into other representations that the students would already have been exposed to, such as a circle/pie, a number line, or a building blocks.  When transforming between representations, students can begin to see what is conserved and what is highlighted.
 
Describe how your proposal alligns with ICAT goals *
Goals include education, transdisiplinary research, and outreach
  We are interested in teaching students, in particular those being introduced to the concept of fractions aloing with those with musical skills but have failed to understand the system of fractions. As a technologically challenging effort as this is, it draws upon the musical, mathematical education, computational thinking, and computer science areas to achieve a robust approach.  In particular, our current research shows that those who are most likely to benefit are students with low socioeconomic status, and we have tailored much of the design and curriculum towards this population.
 
Expertise and experience of investigator(s) *
Describe investigator(s) background and their specific role in the proposal
Chris Frisina:  Chris has had focused research on alternative mathematical education for K12 students for several years.  His research is fueled by his love for music.  He also is the lead developer for the Sound of Fractions program.
Deborah Tatar:  Dr. Tatar has been studying micro coordination and micro worlds in educational curriculum for many years. Her interests in education have lead to the successful development of comprehensive educational tools.
Steve Harrison: Steve has interests in studying communication methods with the integration of technology.  His skills in design help with the minutia of the design.

Detailed project timeline *
Include start / end date, and any milestones.
 Start Date:  Immeadiately upon grant approval
 Milestones:  Purchase the Makey Makey kits (immeadiately)
              Order preparation and shipping. (two weeks)
              Run the study in classrooms, museums, and extra-curricular (approx one month).
              Package the kits for donation and loaning, if this is wanted with ICAT. (two weeks)

Specify location(s) where the research will be conducted *
If ICAT space is needed, please provide specifics below as limitations exist on some locations.
We are planning to do studies at Knowledge Works II, along with studies in the field at school locations and other public venues such as museums.

Specify if any technical support will be needed from ICAT *
If ICAT technical support is needed, please describe specifics below.
Technical support is not needed from ICAT.  However, given that the Makey Makeys are not available for rent from anwhere in the country, we would like to donate the kits to ICAT after the study, which could be loaned or rented to other organizations at the discretion of ICAT, if ICAT is interested in this approach after the study.
