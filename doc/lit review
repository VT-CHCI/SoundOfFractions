The current understanding of the construction of fractions knowledge consisting of partitioning and iterating and splitting.  Partitioning is a reflective abstraction on experiences involving the creation of equal parts from a given whole.  Iterating is a mentally repeating a given length or area to produce a connected whole that is n times as big as the given part. The partitioning operation serves to create 
the equal parts and the iterating operation serves to test whether one of those parts
reproduces the whole when repeated the appropriate number of times.  When the students apply partitioning and iterating sequentially, it is referred to as the Partitive Unit Fraction Scheme (PUFS). Splitting is the simultaneous application of iteration and partitioning, and is preceded by the PUFS.  This is the foundation for Wilkins and Norton's newer fraction knowledge construction called the Splitting Loope is based. The Splitting Loope allows for a more involved approach, which we use the student's current musical skills and knowledge to leverage an stronger introduction into fraction learning.   The Sound of Fractions will match academic coursework with musical challenges to introduce conservation, comparison, equivalence, replacement, reduction, ratio, proportion, multiplication, and division.  The students will be presented predefined musical beats, and allowed to use physical entrainment (matching an auditory rhythm with physical actions/movement) to help reinforce the learning of fractions and their properties across the multiple representations (auditory, physical, visual animation, and visual notation).
