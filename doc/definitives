There is only one type of beat (a unit fraction)
Bead beat is a fixed size (based on visual awareness of the screen size)

tempo is not to be a "first class" representation

"components" are to be arranged horizontally and referred to as "line"s

the capture process should be one step to record the student's song

the implementation must match the curriculum
the implementation should allow for as much customization as possible

persitance is needed for the users

one instrument only is allowed at a time

there will be a labeling system

create and transform a representation are different methods and therefore represented separately

stretch/expanding a song increases its duration, and tempo and divisions/placement remain the same, giving the illusion that the tempo is changing (+ for greater, and - for lesser)

drag and drop beats should preserve order (add or delete)
