There is only one type of beat (a unit fraction)
Bead beat is a fixed size

tempo is not to be a "first class" representation
"components" are to be arranged hiorizontally and referred to as "line"s

the capture should be one step, and record the student's song

the implementation must match the curriculum
the implementation should allow for as much customization as possible
one instrument only is allowed at a time

there will be a labeling system

create and transform a representation are different methods and therefore represented separately
