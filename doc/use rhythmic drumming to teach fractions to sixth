use rhythmic drumming to teach fractions to sixth graders who are a year behind, and are still struggling to learn the concepts of part and whole.

But these are the reasons that this is a good idea:

1) drumming requires dividing up time, and when measured, time shares the ordered, scalar, equivalent-unit properties important in fractions.
2) identification of a single whole is present in both music theory and fractions,
3) drumming is embodied, entrained, fun, and the we leverage the students' current skills and exposure to introduce them to fraction learning in a way that they haven't been before
