Math is about patterns.  We are going to engage in a number of activities that focus on noticing and describing patterns.  Most of our activities are about the underpinnings of fractions, but some of them are about other kinds of patterns. 

give the child a representation of a rhythm, and have them interpret the representation to performa a tapping of the representation
  Different refinement levels of representations
    one highly thought through with colors, structure, looking like 
    one made from another child
  Describe the key features of the representation
    What does it NOT have?
      What do you want to change about this representation (that is not yours)?
      Make one change to the representation.
  overlay the rhythm with their tapping with another sound of another student

listening to a sound, make a represenation
  Compare their representation with another 
    one highly thought through with colors
    One made from another child
