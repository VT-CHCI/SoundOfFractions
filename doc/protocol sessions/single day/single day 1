Math is about patterns.  We are going to engage in a number of activities that focus on noticing and describing patterns.  Most of our activities are about the underpinnings of fractions, but some of them are about other kinds of patterns. 

Representations
  listening to a sound, make a representation
    Compare their representation with another 
      one highly thought through with colors
      one highly thought through highlighting rhythm
      One made from another child

  give the child a representation of a rhythm, and have them interpret the representation to perform a tapping of the representation
    Different refinement levels of representations
      one highly thought through with colors, structure, looking like 
      one made from another child
    Describe the key features of the representation
      What does it NOT have?
        What do you want to change about this representation (that is not yours)?
        Make one change to the representation.
    overlay the rhythm with their tapping with another sound of another student

Labeling
  Listening to a sound
    use words to describe the rhythm
    Look at a collection of words and arrange them 
  Looking at a representation (maybe their own)
    Given a word, describe the representation using that word
      Parts | whole | smaller/larger/greater/less | first/second/third | 

Music
  Tap it in, replay it, and describe any differences
  Make a representation in SoF and the hit play.  Have them play/sing what they expect.
    Have them loop their rhythm with their hands tapping, and then have keep playing when the SoF rhythm starts at the same time (the teacher may have to hit start for them)
    Describe what is different than what they expect
  Ask to describe the similarities and differences between two rhythms
    I O I I O
    I O I O I 
    I I O
    I O I
