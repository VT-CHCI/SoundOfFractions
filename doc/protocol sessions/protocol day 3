Day 3
  GOAL: Knowledge of ability to change 
        Engagement
        [MATH] - 

  DO: Have one student be the metronome repeating the down beat
      every other student plays a beat equally in between the down beats
      divide the rhythm into equal parts and tap it
      this should be a refresher
        who takes what?  sharing
  ASK: did you start by counting or by splitting?
       How did you do it?

  DO: Give the students at each table a particular base rhythm
      One student plays the down beat repeatedly, to privode a sense of the whole
      Ask students to add a beat
        add a beat to (duration) the rhythm at the end (making it longer)
        [this has a bit to do with mixed numbers since the rhythm will be repeated every n+1 times]
  ASK: what happens to [the length of] the rhythm?
        add a beat to (quantity) the rhythm keeping the time the same
  ASK: what happens to [the length of] each beat?
       what is the difference between the two?
       how do you tell this to the another table to get the to understand what you did? [write down]

  DO: Subtract a beat
        don't beat the third beat
        remove a beat (duration) from the rhythm at the end (making it shorter)
  ASK: what happens to [the length of] the rhythm?
        remove a beat (quantity) from the rhythm keeping the time the same
  ASK: what happens to [the length of] each beat?

  
  DO: multiply
        harmony or other people added in succession
        speed up
  ASK: 
  
  DO: equivalence
        2/4 and 4/8
