Day 3: Manipulation of a rhythm
  GOAL: Differentiation between numerator and denominator
        Engagement
        [MATH] - Numerator vs denominator

  Activity 1a: Dividing the whole
    DO: Have one student be the 'metronome' repeating the down beat.
        Every other student plays a beat equally in between the down beats.
        Divide the rhythm into equal parts and tap it
        Note: this should be a refresher
          Who takes what? (sharing)
    ASK: Did you start by counting or by splitting?
         How did you do it?

  Activity 1b: Add a beat
    DO: Give the students at each table a particular base rhythm
        One student plays the down beat repeatedly, to provide a sense of the whole
        Ask students to add a beat to the end in the same division
          add a beat to (duration) the rhythm at the end (making it longer)
          [this has a bit to do with mixed numbers since the rhythm will be repeated every n+1 times]
    ASK: What happens to [the length of] the rhythm?
         What happens to [the length of] the beats?
      
    DO: Ask the students to add a beat to (quantity) the rhythm keeping the time the same
    ASK: What happens to [the length of] each beat?
         What is the difference between the two [previous?
         What happens to [the length of] the beats?
         What is the difference between the two [previous?
         How do you tell this to the another table to get the to understand what you did? [write down]

  Activity 1c: Subtraction
    DO: Subtract a beat
        Remove a beat (duration) from the rhythm at the end (making it shorter)
        Don't beat the third beat
    ASK: What happens to [the length of] the rhythm?
        Don't tap a beat (reducing numerator quantity) from the rhythm keeping the time the same
    ASK: What happens to [the length of] each beat?
  
  Activity 1d: Multiply
    DO: Multiply the rhythm by playing it 2 or three times (harmony or other people added in succession)
        Play the rhythm in double time (twice as fast)
        Play the rhythm in half time (half as slow)
    ASK: How far into the rhythm does the other person start?   
         What happens to [the length of] the rhythm?
         If one person plays it half time, and the other person plays it double time, which one is greater?
    TAKEAWAY: Double time is one quarter of Half time.
