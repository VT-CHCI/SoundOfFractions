Day 6: Labeling
  GOAL: Understanding context when considering parts and wholes

  Activity 1:
    DO: A rhythm repeats itself.
    ASK: How do you know what is the first beat?
         How do you count the beats during the first set.
           - Is there a way to talk about the beats in between the down beat?
           - do they have names?

  Activity 2:
    ASK: There are 16 beats in a rhythm.  If there are 4 people, how many beats does each person get?

  Activity 3:
    DO: Provide another popular rhythm for all students to hear.
    ASK: Have the students make the rhythm in Sound of Fractions.
         Label the rhythm.
         What did you label?
         Compare your labels with other students.
         Write the labels on the board for everyone to see.
    TAKEAWAY: there are many things to label, and it depends on the context. Looking at all the students' answers will help see all the possible contexts.
