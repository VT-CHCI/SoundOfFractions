Math is about patterns.  We are going to engage in a number of activities that focus on noticing and describing patterns.  Most of our activities are about the underpinnings of fractions, but some of them are about other kinds of patterns. 

Day 1
  GOAL: Gain familiarity with description terminology for rhythms
        Engagement
        Embodied experience of parts and wholes
    DO: Play the hook of a popular rhythm
    ASK: Ask the students to describe the rhythm aloud to the teacher
    TAKEAWAY: Hear main words of students' descriptions

    DO: Teacher taps their own rhythm
        Teacher makes their own representation, but doesn't show it to the students
        For individual student sessions, we can use the same representation

    DO: Students to make their own short duration rhythm by tapping on the desk
         students repeat their rhythm (2-4 times) to make sure they know it well
         students to make their own representation by (write words,cut paper,color/draw,make using manipulatives[play-doh,blocks])
         exchange representations and listen to how their rhythm is played by others
    ASK: (Whole class) Was your rhythm the same when the other person played it as when you created it? How did it differ?  
        Write it in a journal
    ASK (small group): How could we represent the rhythms differently so that another person could reproduce them?
        Write it in a journal

    DO: Students individually come up with new rhythm and modified representations which they then exchange.
    ASK:(whole class) What did you discover about how to get another person to play what you wanted them to play?
   
    TAKEAWAY: Ways to represent a rhythm and some of the words people use

    when making a representation if a student makes a 'traditional musical' representation, we have them make another
