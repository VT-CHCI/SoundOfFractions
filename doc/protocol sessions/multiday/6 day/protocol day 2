Math is about patterns.  We are going to engage in a number of activities that focus on noticing and describing patterns.  Most of our activities are about the underpinnings of fractions, but some of them are about other kinds of patterns. 

Day 2
  GOAL: Strengthen terminology introduced in the first session
        Engagement
        Embodied experience of equality [for comparison]
        [MATH] - 

  DO: Make a rhythm
      Ask the students to describe in words the rhythm aloud to a partner
      Have the student tap out their rhythm back
      Reverse rolls
  ASK: What important words did you use? (write down)
  TAKEAWAY: 

  DO: Split a rhythm evenly so that each person is responsible for an equal part.
  ASK: What is "equal"?
  How did you do it?
  Is it always possible to split something equally? (write down)
  TAKEAWAY: Equal splitting

  { DO: draw your own "pizza slices" without looking at one another        }
  { ASK: does everyone have the same number?                               }
  {      does everyone have the same amount?                               }
  { TAKEAWAY: Equal size must happen to compare fractions                  }

  DO: Tables of students that each have different numbers of students (2, 3, 4). Each table of students is presented with a different rhythm via hitting the play button on the table and repeating it by drumming on the desk. [until comfortable]
      One table will play out halves, another thirds, another fourths, another fifths to the class.
      Split
  ASK: Who has more beats?
  ASK: Who has a longer rhythm? Who plays more of the rhythm (if not equal)?
  TAKEAWAY: Size of the whole must be equal in order to compare fractions mathematically
  DO: Rotate to other tables and repeat

  DO: Each make your own rhythm
  ASK: Who has more beats?
  TAKEAWAY: Equal size must happen to compare fractions
