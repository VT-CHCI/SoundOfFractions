Math is about patterns.  We are going to engage in a number of activities that focus on noticing and describing patterns.  Most of our activities are about the underpinnings of fractions, but some of them are about other kinds of patterns. 

Day 2: Strengthen terminology, wholes, parts, splitting, and different sizes
  GOAL: Strengthen terminology introduced in the first session
        Engagement
        Embodied experience of equality [for comparison]
        [MATH] - 
  
  Activity 1
    DO: Make a rhythm
        Ask the students to describe in words the rhythm aloud to a partner
        Have the student tap out their rhythm back
        Use additional words to correct the attempt of tapping the rhythm
        Reverse rolls
    ASK: What important words did you use? (write down in journal new page)
    TAKEAWAY: 

  Activity 2
    DO: Split a rhythm evenly so that each person is responsible for an equal part.
    ASK: What is "equal"?
    How did you do it?
    Is it always possible to split something equally? (write down)
    TAKEAWAY: Equal splitting

  Activity 3: Pizza and cutting
    DO: draw your own "pizza" and cut[draw] it into "slices" without looking at one another
    ASK: does everyone have the same number?                       
         does everyone have the same size of pizza?                       
    TAKEAWAY: Equal size must happen to compare fractions easier

  Activity 4: Pizza and splitting
    DO: Provide the scenario that the students:
        There are ___ kids on a band trip.  The teacher orders ___ pizzas.  How much pizza does each student get if they share it equally?
    ASK: Ask the students how they solved it.
    DO: Provide the scenario that the students:
        There are ___ kids on a band trip.  The teacher orders ___ Large pizzas and ___ Medium pizzas because the pizza place is having a promotion sale.  How much pizza does each student get if they share it equally?
    ASK: Ask the students how they solved it and what parts are important.
    TAKEAWAY: How to split uneven 'wholes' 

  Activity 5
    DO: Play a rhythm with two beats just ONCE
      X X 
    ASK: How many beats are there?
         How many spaces/rests/off beats are there?
         How many divisions/total parts (beats and spaces/rests/off beats) are there?
    DO: Play a rhythm with two beats just ONCE
      X . X 
    ASK: How many beats are there?
         How many spaces/rests/off beats are there?
         How many divisions are there?
    DO: Play a rhythm with two beats just ONCE
      X . X .
    ASK: Was that one or two?
         How do you know what the whole is?
    TAKEAWAY: You need to know what a whole of a what you are comparing is

  Activity 6
    DO: Tables of students that each have different numbers of students (2, 3, 4, 5). Each table of students is presented with a different rhythm via hitting the play button on the table and repeating it by drumming on the desk. [until comfortable]
      One table will play out halves, another thirds, another fourths, another fifths to the class.
        Halves:
        X X . . 
        X . X . 
        Thirds
        X X X . . . . . .
        X . . X . . X . .
        Fourths
        X X X X . . . . . . . . . . . .
        X . . . X . . . X . . . X . . .
        Fifths
        X X X X X . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
        X . . . . X . . . . X . . . . X . . . . X . . . .
      Split the beats among each person in the group
    ASK: questions based on each table:
      Who has more beats at your own table?
      Who plays more of the rhythm (if not equal)?
    ASK: questions based on the entire class
      Who has a longer rhythm?

    TAKEAWAY: Size of the whole must be equal in order to compare fractions mathematically
    DO: Rotate to other tables and repeat

    Notes : the beat rhythms may need play buttons to place once, play, three times, and play repeatedly...

  Activity 7
    DO: Each make your own rhythm [using any number of beats/rests]
    ASK: Who has more beats?
         Who has more rests?
    DO: Each make your own rhythm using 4 beats.
    ASK: How many beats do you each have?
         Who has bigger/longer beats and who has shorter?
    TAKEAWAY: you need to know the size of the whole to compare fractions
